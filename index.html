The big cable companies are back &mdash; and this time they're going through the courts to try to kill the Net Neutrality rules we won earlier this year.

        Without Net Neutrality, the big cable companies would control the Internet, and make it harder for us to access information that doesn't align with what's best for the companies' bottom lines or that disagrees with their political leanings. If Net Neutrality weren't the norm, we might even have been blocked from engaging in the online activism that helped secure the Net Neutrality rules that we're now working to defend!

                It’s an outrage that Congress is considering renewing expired PATRIOT Act provisions and continuing to allow the NSA to spy on all of us. I urge you to vote against reinstating these programs with any bill, and to demand the strongest privacy-protecting amendments possible.

                Will you call your lawmakers to tell them to let the Patriot Act sunset?  Making a phone call is even more effective than sending a letter.  We'll connect you to them and give you a script.  It'll just take a couple of minutes &mdash; and could end mass surveillance.

            <p class="nopad">
                We'll connect you to one of your senators, then your other senator, and then your representative.  Don’t hang up between calls — just press <strong>*</strong> after each call is over to move on to the next one.  You can say:
                <br>
                <br>
                “It’s an outrage that Congress is considering renewing key Patriot Act provisions and continuing to allow the NSA to spy on all of us.  I demand that you vote against reauthorization, and let Section 215 and other provisions expire once and for all."
                <br>
                <br>
                It'd be great if you could make more calls once you're done with your own lawmakers.  If you're able, just keep clicking * after each call, and keep on calling!
